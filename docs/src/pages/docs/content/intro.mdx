# @PWRC Docs

Welcome to the @PWRC documentation!

If you are new to React, this is not the place to start. Go explore the many awesome tutorials
and resources around [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)
to get started.

If `code-splitting` or `suspense on the server` get you excited, this is for you.

## What is this?

@PWRC is a [CLI](/docs/cli) on top of a collection of webpack plugins that exposes a series of
imports that you can utlize to integrate SSR into your hosting provider of choise.

We have built in integrations for Vercel and Express. Head over and read more
[here](/docs/integrations).

### PWRCPlugin

The PWRCPlugin is responsible for providing other plugins based on if it's a client
or server build, along with adding the `lazy-loader` on javascript modules to enable
code-splitting of components.

#### AppShellPlugin

The AppShellPlugin is configured through the PWRCPlugin and is responsible for aliasing
your App file as `@pwrc/app` for use, as well as aliasing or providing a default
`@pwrc/document` that is used on SSR.

#### LazyStatsPlugin

The LazyStatsPlugin is provided by the PWRCPlugin on client builds and is responsible
for generating a `lazy-stats.json` file that contains all the relevant information
required for preloading code-split modules.

#### LazyPlugin

The LazyPlugin is provided by the PWRCPlugin on server builds and is responsible for
providing the information generated on client builds by the LazyStatsPlugin to the
server runtime. This is done via the DefinePlugin and watches for changes in dev mode.
This plugin also provides the information to the `lazy-loader` for manipulationn of
the lazy function calls.
